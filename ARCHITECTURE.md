## Layering Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             app/api/ (Routes)           │  ← HTTP edge, auth, validation only
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│          lib/services/ (Domain)         │  ← Business logic, NO infrastructure
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│     lib/workspace/, lib/security/,      │
│     lib/email/, lib/stripe/, etc.       │  ← Infrastructure / utilities
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         lib/db (Prisma + PostgreSQL)    │  ← Data layer
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Hard rules:**
- ✗ No business logic in `app/api/` routes — delegate everything to a service
- ✗ No direct `prisma.*` calls from route files
- ✗ No tight coupling between feature services — use shared utilities or events
- ✓ Services are stateless static-method classes
- ✓ Route files: `requireAuth()` → `requireWorkspaceRole/Access()` → call service → return `apiSuccess/apiError`

## Action Handlers

Dynamic asset actions are dispatched via `lib/action-handlers/`:

```
lib/action-handlers/
  index.ts          ← executeAction() dispatcher (entry point)
  types.ts          ← Shared ActionResult type
  api.ts            ← HTTP API call actions
  script.ts         ← Agent script execution actions
  webhook.ts        ← Outbound webhook actions
  remote-command.ts ← Remote shell command actions
  manual.ts         ← Manual (human-review) action stubs
```

To add a new action handler type:
1. Create `lib/action-handlers/<type>.ts` exporting `handle<Type>Action()`
2. Add the case to the `switch` in `lib/action-handlers/index.ts`
3. That's it — `AssetService.executeAction` picks it up automatically

---

## Adding a New Feature

### New API endpoint

1. Create `app/api/<feature>/route.ts`
2. Auth guard: `requireAuth()` + `requireWorkspaceRole/Access()`
3. Validate body with `zod`
4. Delegate to the appropriate service
5. Return `apiSuccess(data)` or `apiError(status, message)` — **never** `NextResponse.json()` directly

### Schema coercion guidelines

- Use `z.coerce.number()` for numeric query params and body fields that may arrive as strings (form data, multipart)
- Avoid `.or(z.string().transform(...))` patterns — they produce `string | number` union output types that break service call sites
- Use `z.coerce.number().int().optional()` for optional integer fields (e.g. sort order, position)

### New service

1. Create `lib/services/<Feature>Service.ts` as a static-method class
2. All Prisma calls live here — never in the route
3. Throw errors with `Object.assign(new Error('...'), { statusCode: 4xx })` for route-layer handling
4. If the feature owns multiple concerns (>3 logical groups), split into sibling services from day one
5. Import service input types when calling from routes — never use `as any` casts at the call site

### New dynamic asset action type

See the "Action Handlers" section above.

## Known Improvement Opportunities

### Pending: `ZtnaPolicy` Prisma schema model

`ZtnaService` references `(prisma as any).ztnaPolicy` because the `ZtnaPolicy` model exists in the service
but has not yet been added to `prisma/schema.prisma`.  
**Resolution:** Add `ZtnaPolicy` model to the schema and run `prisma generate` — the `as any` casts will be removable immediately after.



---

## Audit

All mutations must call `prisma.auditLog.create(...)` or use `auditLog()` from `lib/workspace/auditLog.ts`. Route files must never call audit log directly.

## Singleton Services

Some infrastructure services use an instance-export pattern (`export const x = new X()`) rather than static methods. This is acceptable for services that maintain internal state (connection pools, retry counters, etc.). They still live in `lib/services/`.

Examples: `AlertEvaluatorService`, `NotificationOrchestratorService`, `WebhookNotificationService`, `AlertEmailService`.
